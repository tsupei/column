TL;DR;

Pathways is a next-generation AI architecture introduced by Google in 2021.

---

Summary

1. `Multi-task:` Pathways handles thousands of tasks.
2. `Multi-modal:` Pathways handles multi-modal inputs in one model.
3. `Sparse architectures:` Pathways makes models more sparse and efficient.

Review Pathways in 2024

After 3 years, there are some new and widely used technology comply with the concept of Pathways.

---

1. Most LLMs in 2024 like LLaMa-3, GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 can handle multi-tasks at once.
2. With instruction-tuning, it can be even powerful on a set of tasks
3. With PEFT like LoRA and adapters, an LLM can be extended to handle even more tasks. 
4. PaLI, Gemini, GPTs can handle multi-modal inputs.
5. MoE(Mixture of Experts): It's a kind of sparse transformer architecture that route the tokens to specific experts to make the model more powerful and efficient.
